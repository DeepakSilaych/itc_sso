# 🔐 SSO: One Login To Rule Them All

A Django-powered Single Sign-On (SSO) service that lets you authenticate once and rule all your applications. Because who has time to remember multiple passwords?

![SSO Flow Diagram](/static/img/sso-flow.png)

## 🚀 Features That Make Life Easier

- **Seamless Authentication**: One account to access them all, one password to find them
- **Session Management**: Keep track of who's who in your digital kingdom
- **API Integration**: RESTful endpoints that play nice with others
- **Security First**: Because we care about your digital well-being
- **User Management**: Control who gets the keys to your kingdom

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Django 4.x (Because Python is love ❤️)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (The elephant that never forgets 🐘)
- **Cache**: Redis (Because speed is what you need ⚡)
- **API**: Django REST Framework (RESTful done right ✨)

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

1. Clone this bad boy:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devclub-iitd/SingleSignOn.git
   cd SingleSignOn
   ```

2. Set up your virtual environment (because isolation is good):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create your `.env` file (shhh... it's a secret):

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your super secret configurations
   ```

5. Run migrations:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Create a superuser (with great power comes great responsibility):

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. Launch the rocket:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

8. Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## 🔌 Integration

### Client Side

```python
from sso_client import SSOClient

sso = SSOClient(
    client_id="your_client_id",
    client_secret="your_client_secret"
)

# Magic happens here
user = sso.authenticate(token)
```

### Server Side

```python
@login_required
def your_protected_view(request):
    return HttpResponse("If you see this, you're authenticated! 🎉")
```

## 🔒 Security Features

- JWT-based authentication (because we're fancy)
- Rate limiting (to keep the bad guys at bay)
- Session encryption (your secrets are safe with us)
- CORS protection (because boundaries are important)
